# Angular Dynamic Markdown Indic

This is an attempt to make [Plnkr](http://plnkr.co/edit/) styled editor for [Magic Author](https://www.magicauthor.com) website for making eBooks.

Currently supports the following features:


- A multistep form with dynamic form fields based on AngularJS
- Text area with [Toopay's](https://github.com/toopay/bootstrap-markdown) Markdown editor
- [Indic script](https://github.com/vinoth3v/Kanni) (a third party JS) plugin to write in Indian regional languages.
- Live preview based on [markdown-editpreview-ng.js](https://github.com/codemwnci/markdown-editpreview-ng.js)
- Clickable navigation interface similar to Plnkr. Reference: https://github.com/blackgate/bg-splitter
- Disabled full screen mode
- Make side Preview within a box similar Plnkr.co/edit
- Feature to Delete any Chapter
- Auto save feature


Things to do:
- Ask confirmation before closing the window; ask only if the page is not saved.
- Need to plugin [Bindonce](https://github.com/Pasvaz/bindonce) for high performance binding
- Title wise segregation
